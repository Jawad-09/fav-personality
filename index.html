              Liaquat Ali Khan was born in Uttar Pradesh in what was then
              British India in October 1895.[1] He was educated at Aligarh
              Muslim University in India, and then at Oxford
              University.[citation needed] Well-educated, he was a democratic
              political theorist who promoted parliamentarism in India. After
              first being invited by the Congress Party, he opted for the Muslim
              League led by influential Muhammad Ali Jinnah who was advocating
              the eradication of the injustices and ill-treatment meted out to
              Indian Muslims by the British government. He pursued his role in
              the independence movements of India and Pakistan, while serving as
              the first Finance Minister in the interim government of British
              Indian Empire, prior to the independence and partition of India in
              1947.[citation needed] Ali Khan assisted Jinnah in campaigning for
              the creation of a separate state for Indian Muslims.
